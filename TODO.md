# Plan for forms of level one

The goal is to have efficient implementations of:

1. Delta
2. Eisenstein series E_k
3. the normalised generators Delta16, Delta18, Delta20, Delta22, and Delta26 of the corresponding one-dimensional spaces of cusp forms
4. the Victor Miller basis for the space of cusp forms S_k
5. Hecke operators on q-expansions
6. Hecke operators as matrices on S_k (via Victor Miller basis).
